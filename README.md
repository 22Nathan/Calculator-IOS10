# GraphCalculator-Swift-IOS10
Implementation Programming Project in Developing Apps for IOS CS193P<br>
I just started learning this course,and this is my programming project for one to three.Unfortunately,I did not found useful repositories in github about the project.So I hope my repositories will help.<br>
Although I implement most of the functions as asked to,I think there's a lot to be improved. Welcome to pull requests :)<br>
star if you like :)<br>

# Function

* Basic Calculator operation<br>
* Shows the sequence of operands and operations <br>
* support variable M<br>
* Graph Calculator,support sin and cos now.<br>

# To Fix
* I haved marked three places to be improved,see /* To Be improved here */
* I have implement a generic point depiction method in the GraphView.However,the difficult point for me now is how to pass the argument (e.g. y = 6x)
